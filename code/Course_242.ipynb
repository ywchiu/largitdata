            "In customer service technical support, swiftly and accurately retrieving relevant past issues is critical for efficiently resolving customer inquiries. The conventional retrieval methods in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for large language models (LLMs) treat a large corpus of past issue tracking tickets as plain text, ignoring the crucial intra-issue structure and inter-issue relations, which limits performance. We introduce a novel customer service question-answering method that amalgamates RAG with a knowledge graph (KG). Our method constructs a KG from historical issues for use in retrieval, retaining the intra-issue structure and inter-issue relations. During the question-answering phase, our method parses consumer queries and retrieves related sub-graphs from the KG to generate answers. This integration of a KG not only improves retrieval accuracy by preserving customer service structure information but also enhances answering quality by mitigating the effects of text segmentation. Empirical assessments on our benchmark datasets, utilizing key retrieval (MRR, Recall@K, NDCG@K) and text generation (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR) metrics, reveal that our method outperforms the baseline by 77.6% in MRR and by 0.32 in BLEU. Our method has been deployed within LinkedIn’s customer service team for approximately six months and has reduced the median per-issue resolution time by 28.6%.\n",

            "\n",
            "Effective technical support in customer service underpins product success, directly influencing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Given the frequent similarity of customer inquiries to previously resolved issues, the rapid and accurate retrieval of relevant past instances is crucial for the efficient resolution of such inquiries. Recent advancements in embedding-based retrieval (EBR), large language models (LLMs), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have significantly enhanced retrieval performance and question-answering capabilities for the technical support of customer service. This process typically unfolds in two stages: first, historical issue tickets are treated as plain text, segmented into smaller chunks to accommodate the context length constraints of embedding models; each chunk is then converted into an embedding vector for retrieval. Second, during the question-answering phase, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks and feeds them as contexts for LLMs to generate answers in response to queries. Despite its straightforward approach, this method encounters several limitations:\n",
            "\n",
            "- Limitation 1 - Compromised Retrieval Accuracy from Ignoring Structures: Issue tracking documents such as Jira possess inherent structure and are interconnected, with references such as \"issue A is related to/copied from/caused\"\n",

            "\n",
            "Limitation 1 - Loss of Intrinsic Relationship: The conventional approach of compressing documents into text chunks leads to the loss of vital information. Our approach parses issue tickets into trees and further connects individual issue tickets to form an interconnected graph, which maintains this intrinsic relationship among entities, achieving high retrieval performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "Limitation 2 - Reduced Answer Quality from Segmentation: Segmenting extensive issue tickets into fixed-length segments to accommodate the context length constraints of embedding models can result in the disconnection of related content, leading to incomplete answers. Our graph-based parsing method overcomes this by preserving the logical coherence of ticket sections, ensuring the delivery of complete and high-quality responses.\n",

            "Question answering (QA) with knowledge graphs (KGs) can be broadly classified into retrieval-based, template-based, and semantic parsing-based methods. Retrieval-based approaches utilize relation extraction or distributed representations to derive answers from KGs, but they face difficulties with questions involving multiple entities. Template-based strategies depend on manually-created templates for encoding complex queries, yet are limited by the scope of available templates. Semantic parsing methods map text to logical forms containing predicates from KGs.\n",

During the KG construction phase, our system constructs a comprehensive knowledge graph from historical customer service issue tickets. It integrates a tree-structured representation of each issue and interlinks them based on relational context. It also generates embedding for each node to facilitate later semantic searching. During the question-answering phase, our method parses consumer queries to identify named entities and intents, then navigates within the KG to identify related sub-graphs for generating answers.\n",

Concurrently, the query intents I include the entities mentioned in the graph template T that the query aims to address. We leverage LLM with a suitable prompt in this parsing process. For instance, given the query 𝑞 = \"How to reproduce the login issue where a user can’t log in to LinkedIn?\", the extracted entity is P = Map(\"issue summary\" → \"login issue\", \"issue description\" → \"user can’t log in to LinkedIn\"), and the intent set is I=Set(\"fix solution\").

The control group operated with conventional text-based EBR, while the experimental group applied the methodology outlined in this study. For both groups, we utilized the same LLM, specifically GPT-4 [ 1], and the same embedding model, E5 [17 ]. We measured retrieval efficacy using Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), recall@K, and NDCG@K. MRR gauges the average inverse rank of the initial correct response, recall@K determines the likelihood of a relevant item’s appearance within the top K selections, and NDCG@K appraises the rank quality by considering both position and pertinence of items.

The conventional retrieval methods in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for large language models (LLMs) treat a large corpus of past issue tracking tickets as plain text, ignoring the crucial intra-issue structure and inter-issue relations, which limits performance. We introduce a novel customer service question-answering method that amalgamates RAG with a knowledge graph (KG). Our method constructs a KG from historical issues for use in retrieval, retaining the intra-issue structure and inter-issue relations. During the question-answering phase, our method parses consumer queries and retrieves related sub-graphs from the KG to generate answers. This integration of a KG not only improves retrieval accuracy by preserving customer service structure information but also enhances answering quality by mitigating the effects of text segmentation. Empirical assessments on our benchmark datasets, utilizing key retrieval (MRR, Recall@K, NDCG@K) and text generation (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR) metrics, reveal that our method outperforms the baseline by 77.6% in MRR and by 0.32 in BLEU. Our method has been deployed within LinkedIn’s customer service team for approximately six months and has reduced the median per-issue resolution time by 28.6%.\n\n CCS CONCEPTS\n\n• Computing methodologies → Information extraction; Natural language generation.\n\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Given the frequent similarity of customer inquiries to previously resolved issues, the rapid and accurate retrieval of relevant past instances is crucial for the efficient resolution of such inquiries. Recent advancements in embedding-based retrieval (EBR), large language models (LLMs), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have significantly enhanced retrieval performance and question-answering capabilities for the technical support of customer service. This process typically unfolds in two stages: first, historical issue tickets are treated as plain text, segmented into smaller chunks to accommodate the context length constraints of embedding models; each chunk is then converted into an embedding vector for retrieval. Second, during the question-answering phase, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks and feeds them as contexts for LLMs to generate answers in response to queries. Despite its straightforward approach, this method encounters several limitations:\n\n- Limitation 1 - Compromised Retrieval Accuracy from Ignoring Structures: Issue tracking documents such as Jira possess inherent structure and are interconnected, with references such as \"issue A is related to/copied from/caused\"\n---\n SIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA Zhentao Xu, et al.\n\nLimitation 1 - Loss of Intrinsic Relationship: The conventional approach of compressing documents into text chunks leads to the loss of vital information. Our approach parses issue tickets into trees and further connects individual issue tickets to form an interconnected graph, which maintains this intrinsic relationship among entities, achieving high retrieval performance.\n\nLimitation 2 - Reduced Answer Quality from Segmentation: Segmenting extensive issue tickets into fixed-length segments to accommodate the context length constraints of embedding models can result in the disconnection of related content, leading to incomplete answers. Our graph-based parsing method overcomes this by preserving the logical coherence of ticket sections, ensuring the delivery of complete and high-quality responses.\n\n RELATED WORK\n\nQuestion answering (QA) with knowledge graphs (KGs) can be broadly classified into retrieval-based, template-based, and semantic parsing-based methods. Retrieval-based approaches utilize relation extraction or distributed representations to derive answers from KGs, but they face difficulties with questions involving multiple entities. Template-based strategies depend on manually-created templates for encoding complex queries, yet are limited by the scope of available templates. Semantic parsing methods map text to logical forms containing predicates from KGs.\n\nRecent advancements in large language models (LLMs) integration with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have demonstrated notable progress. For graph-based reasoning, Think-on-Graph and Reasoning-on-Graph enhance LLMs’ reasoning abilities by integrating KGs. LLM-based question answering systems employ KGs to boost inference capabilities in specialized domains.\n\n METHODS\n\nWe introduce an LLM-based customer service question answering system that seamlessly integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with a knowledge graph (KG). Our system comprises two phases: KG construction phase and question-answering phase. During the KG construction phase, our system constructs a comprehensive knowledge graph from historical customer service issue tickets. It integrates a tree-structured representation of each issue and interlinks them based on relational context.\n\nSemantic parsing methods map text to logical forms containing predicates from KGs.\n\nRecent advancements in large language models (LLMs) integration with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have demonstrated notable progress.

The left side of this diagram illustrates the knowledge graph construction; the right side shows the retrieval and question answering process.\n\n 3.2 Retrieval and Question Answering\n\n 3.2.1 Query Entity Identification and Intent Detection.\n\nIn this step, we extract the named entities P of type Map(N → V) and the query intent set I from each user query 𝑞. The method involves parsing each query 𝑞 into a key-value pair, where each key 𝑛, mentioned within the query, corresponds to an element in the graph template T, and the value 𝑣 represents the information extracted from the query. Concurrently, the query intents I include the entities mentioned in the graph template T that the query aims to address. We leverage LLM with a suitable prompt in this parsing process. For instance, given the query 𝑞 = \"How to reproduce the login issue where a user can’t log in to LinkedIn?\", the extracted entity is P = Map(\"issue summary\" → \"login issue\", \"issue description\" → \"user can’t log in to LinkedIn\"), and the intent set is I=Set(\"fix solution\"). This method demonstrates notable flexibility in accommodating varied query formulations by leveraging the LLM’s extensive understanding and interpretive capabilities.\n\n 3.2.2 Embedding-based Retrieval of Sub-graphs.\n\nOur method extracts pertinent sub-graphs from the knowledge graph, aligned with user-provided specifics such as \"issue description\" and \"issue summary\", as well as user intentions like \"fix solution\". This process consists of two primary steps: EBR-based ticket identification and LLM-driven subgraph extraction.\n---\n SIGIR ’24, July 14–18, 2024, Washington, DC, USA\n\nZhentao Xu, et al.\n\nthe same ticket, we rank and select the top 𝐾 ticket tickets.

The team was split randomly into two groups: one used our system, while the other stuck to traditional manual methods. As shown in Table 3, the group using our system achieved significant gains, reducing the median resolution time per issue by 28.6%. This highlights our system’s effectiveness in enhancing customer service efficiency.\n\nThe table compares the time taken for a task when a tool is used versus when the tool is not used.,\nwith the following table title:\nComparison of Task Time with and without Tool,\nwith the following columns:\n- Group: None\n- Mean: None\n- P50: None\n- P90: None\n\n\nThe table compares the time taken for a task when a tool is used versus when the tool is not used.,\nwith the following table title:\nComparison of Task Time with and without Tool,\nwith the following columns:\n- Group: None\n- Mean: None\n- P50: None\n- P90: None\n\n|Group|Mean|P50|P90|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Tool Not Used|40 Hours|7 Hours|87 Hours|\n|Tool Used|15 hours|5 hours|47 hours|\n\n\nAnswer Generation. Answers are synthesized by correlating retrieved data from Section 3.2.2 with the initial query. The LLM serves as a decoder to formulate responses to user inquiries given the retrieved information. For robust online serving, if query execution encounters issues, a fallback mechanism reverts to a baseline text-based retrieval method.\n\n EXPERIMENT\n\n Experiment Design\n\nOur evaluation employed a curated \"golden\" dataset comprising typical queries, support tickets, and their authoritative solutions. The control group operated with conventional text-based EBR, while the experimental group applied the methodology outlined in this study. For both groups, we utilized the same LLM, specifically GPT-4 [ 1], and the same embedding model, E5 [17 ]. We measured retrieval efficacy using Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), recall@K, and NDCG@K. MRR gauges the average inverse rank of the initial correct response, recall@K determines the likelihood of a relevant item’s appearance within the top K selections, and NDCG@K appraises the rank quality by considering both position and pertinence of items. For question-answering performance, we juxtaposed the \"golden\" solutions against the generated responses, utilizing metrics such as BLEU [11], ROUGE [9], and METEOR [3] scores.\n\n Result and Analysis\n\nThe retrieval and question-answering performances are presented in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Across all metrics, our method demonstrates consistent improvements. Notably, it surpasses the baseline by 77.6% in MRR and by 0.32 in BLEU score, substantiating its superior retrieval efficacy and question-answering accuracy.\n\n CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\n\nIn conclusion, our research significantly advances automated question answering systems for customer service. Integrating retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with a knowledge graph (KG) has improved retrieval and answering metrics, and overall service effectiveness. Future work will focus on: developing an automated mechanism for extracting graph templates, enhancing system adaptability; investigating dynamic updates to the knowledge graph based on user queries to improve real-time responsiveness; and exploring the system’s applicability in other contexts beyond customer service.\n\n COMPANY PORTRAIT\n\nAbout LinkedIn: Founded in 2003, LinkedIn connects the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful.

會議論文集中，2024年7月14日至18日，美國華盛頓特區。ACM，美國紐約，5頁。\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1145/3626772.3661370\n\n 1 引言\n\n客戶服務中有效的技術支援是產品成功的基礎，直接影響客戶滿意度和忠誠度。考慮到客戶詢問通常與先前解決的問題相似，迅速且準確地檢索相關的過去實例對於高效解決此類問題至關重要。最近在基於嵌入的檢索（EBR）、大型語言模型（LLMs）和檢索增強的生成（RAG）方面的進展顯著提升了技術支援客戶服務的檢索性能和問答能力。這一過程通常分為兩個階段：首先，將歷史問題工單視為純文本，分段為較小的塊以容納嵌入模型的上下文長度約束；然後將每個塊轉換為一個嵌入向量以進行檢索。其次，在問答階段，系統檢索最相關的塊並將它們作為上下文提供給LLMs，以根據查詢產生答案。儘管這種方法看似簡單，但遇到了幾個限制：\n\n- 限制1 - 從忽略結構中犧牲檢索準確性：問題追踪文檔如Jira具有固有結構且相互關聯，包括“問題A與...有關/復制自/導致”\n\n---\n SIGIR ’24，2024年7月14日至18日，美國華盛頓特區，Zhentao Xu等。\n\n限制1 - 因分割而失去內在關係：將文檔壓縮為文本塊的傳統方法會導致重要信息的丟失。我們的方法將問題工單解析為樹狀結構，並進一步連接單個問題工單以形成一個相互關聯的圖，保持實體之間的內在關係，從而實現高效的檢索性能。\n\n限制2 - 因分割導致答案質量降低：將廣泛的問題工單分割為固定長度的段落以滿足嵌入模型的上下文長度約束可能導致相關內容的分離，導致答案不完整。我們基於圖的解析方法通過保留票務部分的邏輯一致性來克服這一問題，確保提供完整和高質量的答案。\n\n 相關工作\n\n基於知識圖（KGs）的問答（QA）可以廣泛分為檢索式、基於模板和基於語義解析的方法。檢索式方法利用關係提取或分佈式表示來從KGs中產生答案，但在涉及多個實體的問題上存在困難。基於模板的策略依賴於手動創建的模板來編碼複雜查詢，但受到可用模板範圍的限制。語義解析方法將文本映射到包含來自KGs的謂詞的邏輯形式。\n\n最近在大型語言模型（LLMs）與知識圖（KGs）集成方面取得了顯著進展。針對圖形式的推理，Think-on-Graph和Reasoning-on-Graph通過整合KGs增強了LLMs的推理能力。基於LLMs的問答系統利用KGs提升了專業領域中的推理能力。\n\n 方法\n\n我們介紹了一個基於LLM的客戶服務問答系統，該系統無縫集成了檢索增強的生成（RAG）和知識圖（KG）。我們的系統包括兩個階段：知識圖構建階段和問答階段。在知識圖構建階段，我們的系統從歷史客戶服務問題工單中構建了一個全面的知識圖。它使用每個問題的樹狀結構化表示，並根據關聯上下文將它們進行互連。\n\n語義分析方法將文本對應到包含知識圖譜中謂詞的邏輯形式。\n\n最近將大型語言模型（LLMs）與知識圖譜（KGs）相結合的先進發展展示了顯著進步。對於基於圖譜的推理，「Think-on-Graph」和「Reasoning-on-Graph」通過整合知識圖譜來增強LLMs的推理能力。基於LLMs的問答系統利用知識圖譜來提升在專門領域中的推理能力。\n\n方法\n\n我們介紹一個基於LLMs的客戶服務問答系統，該系統通過無縫集成檢索增強生成（RAG）和知識圖譜（KG）。我們的系統由兩個階段組成：知識圖譜構建階段和問答階段。在知識圖譜構建階段，我們的系統從歷史客戶服務問題工單中構建一個全面的知識圖譜。它基於關係上下文將每個問題構建為樹狀結構表示，並互相鏈接。它還為每個節點生成嵌入以方便後續的語義搜索。在問答階段，我們的方法解析消費者的查詢以識別命名實體和意圖，然後在知識圖譜中尋找相關子圖用於生成答案。\n\n檢索增強生成結合知識圖譜的客戶服務問答

\"登錄問題\"， \"問題描述\" → \"用戶無法登錄到LinkedIn\" )，意圖集合為I=Set(\"修復解決方案\")。該方法展示了通過利用LLM廣泛的理解和解釋能力，適應各種查詢形式的顯著靈活性。\n\n3.2.2 基於嵌入式檢索的子圖檢索。\n\n我們的方法從知識圖中提取與用戶提供的特定信息，如 \"問題描述\" 和 \"問題摘要\"，以及用戶意圖如 \"修復解決方案\" 相一致的相關子圖。該過程包括兩個主要步驟：基於嵌入式檢索的工單識別和由LLM驅動的子圖提取。\n\n基準和實驗結果在K=1和K=3時的MRR、Recall@K和NDCG@K的比較，\n包含以下表格標題：\n基準與實驗結果比較，\n包含以下欄位：\n- MRR：基準和實驗的平均倒數排名（MRR）值\n- Recall@K：在K=1和K=3時基準和實驗的召回率值\n- NDCG@K：在K=1和K=3時基準和實驗的歸一化折扣積分增益（NDCG）值\n\n基準結果和實驗結果的MRR、Recall@K和NDCG@K在K=1和K=3的比較如下表所示：\n表格標題：基準 vs. 實驗結果\n\n|    |MRR    |Recall@K    |NDCG@K    |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|K=1    |0.522    |0.640    |0.520    |\n|K=3    |0.400    |0.400    |NA    |\n|    |Baseline    |0.927    |1.000    |0.946    |\n|    |Experiment    |0.860    |0.860    |NA    |\n\n在由LLM驅動的子圖提取步驟中，系統首先將原始使用者查詢𝑞重新表述，以包含檢索到的票證ID；然後將修改後的查詢𝑞'翻譯為圖形數據庫語言，例如Cypher用於Neo4j進行問答。\n\n這個表格比較了基準版和實驗版之間的性能指標（BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE），\n表格標題為：\n性能指標比較，\n包括以下列：\n- BLEU：無\n- METEOR：無\n- ROUGE：無\n\n這張表格比較了基準組與實驗組之間的表現指標（BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE），\n表格標題為：表現指標比較，\n包含以下列：\n- BLEU: 無\n- METEOR: 無\n- ROUGE: 無\n\n| |BLEU|METEOR|ROUGE|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|基準組|0.057|0.279|0.183|\n|實驗組|0.377|0.613|0.546|\n\n生產使用案例\n\n我們在 LinkedIn 的客戶服務團隊中部署了我們的方法，涵蓋多個產品線。團隊被隨機分成兩組：一組使用我們的系統，另一組堅持使用傳統的手動方法。如第3表所示，使用我們系統的團隊取得了顯著的收益，將每個問題的中位解決時間減少了28.6%。這突顯了我們系統在提高客戶服務效率方面的有效性。\n\n該表格比較了使用工具和不使用工具時完成任務所需的時間，\n與以下表格標題：\n使用與不使用工具的任務時間比較，\n具有以下列：\n- 組別：無\n- 平均值：無\n- P50：無\n- P90：無\n\n以下是比較使用工具和不使用工具完成任務所需時間的表格:\n\n| 群組 | 平均值 | P50 | P90 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 未使用工具 | 40小時 | 7小時 | 87小時 |\n| 使用工具 | 15小時 | 5小時 | 47小時 |\n\n答案生成。答案是通過將從第3.2.2節檢索的數據與初始查詢相關聯來綜合合成的。LLM作為解碼器，根據獲取的信息來制定對用戶查詢的回答。對於強大的在線服務，如果查詢執行遇到問題，回退機制將恢復到基礎的基於文本的檢索方法。\n\n實驗\n\n實驗設計\n\n我們的評估采用了一個由典型查詢、支持工單及其權威解決方案組成的精選“黃金”數據集。對照組使用傳統的基於文本的EBR，而實驗組應用了本研究中概述的方法。對於兩組，我們使用了相同的LLM，具體是GPT-4 [1]，和相同的嵌入模型，即E5 [17]。我們使用平均倒數排名（MRR）、召回率@K和NDCG@K來衡量檢索效果。MRR評估初始正確回答的平均倒數排名，召回率@K確定相關項目在前K個選擇中出現的可能性，NDCG@K通過同時考慮項目的位置和相關性來評估排名質量。對於問答性能，我們將“黃金”解決方案與生成的回答進行對比，使用BLEU [11]、ROUGE [9]和METEOR [3]等指標進行評分。\n\n結果和分析\n\n檢索和問答表現請見表1和表2。在所有指標上，我們的方法展示了一致的改進。值得注意的是，它在MRR方面超越了基準77.6％，在BLEU評分方面超過了0.32，證實了其優越的檢索效能和問答準確性。\n\n結論和未來工作\n\n總之，我們的研究顯著推進了客戶服務的自動問答系統。將檢索增強生成（RAG）與知識圖（KG）相結合已提升了檢索和回答指標，提高了整體服務效果。未來的工作將專注於：開發一個自動機制來提取圖形模板，增強系統的適應性；根據用戶查詢研究基於知識圖的動態更新，以改善實時響應能力；探索系統在客戶服務之外其他情境中的應用性。\n\n公司簡介\n\n關於LinkedIn:
